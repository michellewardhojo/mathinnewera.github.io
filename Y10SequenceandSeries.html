  <h2>Chapter 3: Sequence and Series</h2>

  <h3>Section 3.1: What is Sequence and Series?</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva1.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> A number sequence refers to the progression of numbers (either increasing or decreasing) that follows a pattern.<br>
  On the other hand, a series refers to the sum of the numbers in that pattern. They are often used to count the total length of an object that's been cut into several pieces, or sometimes just to make the word problem more interesting.<br>
  The image on the left explains this further using examples. A sequence is only the terms lined up, while the series is all the terms added up together.<br>
  There are two types of sequences and series: arithmetic and geometric. The sum and differences of both types are going to be explained further in the next section below.<br><br></p><br>

  <h3>Section 3.2: Arithmetic and Geometric Sequence and Series</b></h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva2.png" class="image3">

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Arithmetic Sequence and Series</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">The first type would be the arithmetic sequence. This sequence follows a pattern of addition or substraction, which we call 'difference' and in an equation, it is represented by the letter d. The first term is generally represented by the letter a. The general rule for an arithmetic sequence is a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d, where a<sub>n</sub> is the general term and n is the number of terms involved. The nth term also means the term that you are to find, for example if the 6th term is required, the n = 6<br>
  For an arithmetic series (or to find the sum of all the terms), the sum of the terms are denoted as 'S<sub>n</sub>', and it's equal to n/2[2a + (n - 1)d], with the letters representing all the same quantities as before.</p><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva3.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>i. Finding the General Rule using First Term and Difference</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Finding the general rule is similar to plugging in the values given, in this case, the first term and the difference. However, since the general rule should work for all values of n, we should just leave the variable n as it is. For example we have a sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.... From this, we have the first term, a = 2, and the difference, d = 2. Just plug in the values into the formula, without changing the value of n.<br>
  a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d = 2 + (n - 1)2<br>
  a<sub>n</sub> = 2 + 2n - 2 = 2n, and we have our general rule.<br>
  Try plugging in a value from the sequence, for this example let's test for n = 2. According to the series, the 2nd term should be 4.<br>
  a<sub>2</sub> = 2(2) = 4, the general rule works and is correct.</p>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva4.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>ii. Finding the Sum and Difference using First and Last Terms</b></p>
  <p   style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">There are questions in which the difference of the sequence is not given. In this case, another formula could work if the last term is provided. We have S<sub>n</sub> = n(a + l)/2, where l is the last term of the sequence.<br>
  A familiar question that you might encounter would be: A rope is cut into 5 pieces, each piece has a different length that can be ordered into an arithmetic sequence. If the shortest piece is 5 cm and the longest is 17cm, find the original length of the rope before it was cut and the difference between the lengths of the pieces. Basically the question didn't tell you the difference between the length of one rope to another, so we can't use the original formula that involves the difference. Using the formula involving the last term would help. The picture on the left illustrates how the problem is solved.</p><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva5.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. Geometric Sequence and Series</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">The second type is the geometric sequence. It works similarly to the arithmetic sequence, but its number progression is affected by multiplying or dividing factors. These factors are commonly called 'ratio' and is represented by the letter r in the equation (it's like the 'd' in an arithmetic sequence). Its general rule is usually written as a<sub>n</sub> = ar<sup>n - 1</sup>, where a is the first term, r is the ratio, and n is the number of terms. The sum of this series is also represented as S<sub>n</sub>, but with a different formula to the arithmetic sequence. For this, we have S<sub>n</sub> = a(r<sup>n-1</sup> - 1)/(r-1).</p><br><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva6.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>i. Finding the General Rule using First Term and Ratio</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Similar to finding the general rule for the arithmetic sequence, all you need to do it plug in those numbers, namely the first term and its ratio. Let's say we have the sequence 1, 3, 9, 27,.... Our ratio is 3, and its first term is 1. Plugging these into the general rule formula we have:<br>
  a<sub>n</sub> = 1 x 3<sup>n - 1</sup> or just 3<sup>n - 1</sup>. <br>
  Let's test this for the second term, it should be equal to 3.<br>
  a<sub>2</sub> = 3<sup>2 - 1</sup> = 3<br>
  This proves to be correct, so our general rule works.<br></p><br>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>ii. Finding the Ratio and Sum using the First and Last Terms</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">The geometric sequence is used in a lot of contexts, one of which is counting the interest of your savings in a bank. Let's say you deposited $100 into your bank account, and every year there is an interest rate of r% from what you originally deposited. So the second year after depositing, you would have $100 + r% x $100. This continues again until you decided to withdraw your money after 8 years of depositing it in that bank. When you withdrew your money, you found out that the interest you gained that year is $7.8125 x 10<sup>-8</sup>. Using this information, we can find out the total money we have when we withdrew the money, and the interest rate applied. The image on the left shows you how.</p>

  <h3>Section 3.3: Finite and Infinite Sequences</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva8.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Finite Sequences</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> Finite sequences refer to sequences that can have its sum calculated, or that it doesn't go on forever. It usually has a last term, or it involves the ratio dividing the previous terms, or the difference substracting the previous terms. <br>
  Example: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0 (difference = -2) or 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (ratio = 1/2)</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. Infinite Sequences</b></p>
  <p  style=" padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> Infinite sequences refer to sequences that goes on and usually has no last term. There are two types of infinite sequences, convergent and divergent.</p>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva9.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>i. Convergent Sequence</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">A convergent sequence refers to an infinite sequence that has its terms approaching a certain number. For example, we have 1, 1/3, 1/9, 1/27, 1/81,... We can see that the terms keep decreasing but will not reach 0. This type of sequence usually involves the ratio being in between 0 and 1 (0 < r < 1), which is correct in this case because its ratio is 1/3. The sum to infinity of a convergent sequence can usually be calculated with the formula S<sub>∞</sub> = a/(1 - r). Using the same example, we can get the sum to infinity to be S<sub>∞</sub> = 1/(1 - 1/3) = 3/2.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva10.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>ii. Divergent Sequence</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Contrasting to a convergent sequence, a divergent sequence keeps going with no limit. When the 'sum to infinty' formula is applied to a divergent series, it wouldn't grant an asnwer that makes sense. Let's say we have 1, 4, 16, 64,.... Using the formula we get S<sub>∞</sub> = 1/(1 - 4) = -1/3, which doesn't make sense because all the terms are whole numbers and are continously increasing. The formula doesn;t work for divergent sequences. This type of sequence usually involves the ratio to be bigger than or equal to 1, or smaller than or equal to -1 (|r| ≥ 1).</p><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 3.4: Sigma Notation</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva11.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> Sometimes the given question can confuse you by using the Greek letter ∑ (read as 'sigma'). They mean similarly to the sum of the sequence that is usually written. The number on top represents the last term of the sequence, and the number at the bottom represents the first term of the sequence. The visuals can be seen more clearly using the image on the right.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 3.5: Proving S<sub>n</sub> Formulas </h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="seqnsercanva12.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">The S<sub>n</sub> can vary in a lot of forms. Sometimes the questions require you to prove if one of its forms is equal to another. The trick here is NEVER to change the equation on the right hand side. It usually requires you to only manipulate the equation on the left hand side, and make it the same form as the one on the right. Another tip is that, to make the question easier to solve, you do not need to expand every single expression. take a look at the equation on the right hand side, if it has a common term with the one on the left hand side, then you might not need to multiply that term with enything else. An example is provided on the right.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
