  <h3 style="width:50vw;  padding:1vw;">Section 6.1: What is an Exponential Function?</h3>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:45vw;">An exponential function is a type of function where a base and an exponent are used to measure and increase or decrease in certain data, such as bacteria population growth. As we have learned in Chapter 1, an exponential expression has a base and an exponent. In this case, we have the function f(x) = b<sup>x</sup>, where b is the base and x is the power/exponent. If transformations of exponential functions would happen, its general form would be f(x) = ab<sup>(x - c)</sup> + d, where b > 0 and not equal to 1, and a is not equal to 0. These new letters will be explained in the next section below.</p><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 6.2: Elements of an Exponential Function</h3>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Vertical Stretch (a)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">In the general form mentioned, the letter a represents the vertical stretch of the function. It affects the y - values by a scale factor of a. The comparisons of an exponential graph with and without its vertical stretch can be seen on the image on the right.</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. Graph Steepness and Base(b)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> The base b also determines how steep the graph becomes. The smaller the value of b, the less steep the graph is. The comparison of the graphs with a higher and a lower value of b can be seen on the image on the right.</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. Horizontal Translation (c)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> The letter c represents the horizontal translation. It affects the function's x - values. If c is positive, the function moves towards the positive x - axis (to the right), and moves towards the negative x - axis (to the left) when c is negative. The graph comparisons between a function with a positive and a negative c - value on the image on the right.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>d. Vertical Translation and Horizontal Asymptote(d)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Finally, the letter d represents the vertical translation as well as the function's horizontal asymptote. It translates the function towards the positive y - axis when d is positive, and translates the function towards the negative y - axis when d is negative. Since the function is exponential, we also learned in Chapter 1 that any number excluding 0, when raised to any power, cannot result as 0. From this, the function would never have a value when f(x) = d, because that means the exponential part of the function should be 0. This is why d is also the function's horizontal aymptote. An asymptote is a line that the graph approaches but never intersects. This applies because the function will only approach f(x) = d, but never actually reach that point. If d is not present in the function, then the horizontal asymptote would be y = 0.</p>

  <h3>Section 8.3: Increase or Decrease of an Exponential Graph</h3>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. The Graph Increases</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> The graph of an exponential function increases when a > 1 and b > 1, or when a < 0 and 0 < b < 1. When a > 1 and b > 1, both variables are positive and keeps increasing. When a < 0 and 0 < b < 1, a is negative while b is a fraction. b keeps increasing even though a is negative, because when a fraction is raised to a power, it actually becomes smaller. A smaller negative number holds a bigger value than a bigger negative number.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expfunc2canva6.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. The Graph Decreases</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> The graph of an exponential function decreases when a < 0 and b > 1, or when a > 0 and 0 < b < 1. When a < 0 and b > 1, a is negative and b is a whole number, and as mentioned before, when whole numbers increase, but a negative value is assigned to each of them, they decrease instead because a bigger negative number holds less value than a smaller negative number. When a > 0 and 0 < b < 1, a is positive, but b is a fraction. Previously discussed, we know that when a fraction is squared, its values actually become smaller, and since a is positive, it doesn't make the function increase like it did in the previous discussion.</p><br><br><br>
