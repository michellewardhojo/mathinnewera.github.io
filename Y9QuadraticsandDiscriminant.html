  <h2>Chapter 4: Quadratics and Discriminant</h2>

  <h3>Section 4.1: What are Quadratics and Discriminant?</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="quadndisc2canva1.png" class="image3">
  <p style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Quadratics are expressions that involve powers of 2, for example x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1. They usually form a symmetrical curve, or parabola, when their graphs are sketched. Quadratics involve different elements, such as the x and y - intercepts, the vertex, and the axis of symmetry. The discriminant of a quadratic function indicates how many roots or solutions that function has. Discriminants have the formula of D = b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac, where D is the discriminant, a is the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup>, b is the coefficient of x, and c is the constant. In this chapter, we are going to diicuss the different forms of writing quadratic functions as well as what different values of dicriminants mean.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 4.2: Elements of a Quadratic Function</h3>
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. x - intercept and y - intercept</b></p>
  <p> x - intercepts indicate coordinates that touch the x - axis, meaning the line y = 0. Hence the y - coordinates of a function will always be 0 on its x - intercept. You can use the x - intercept to find the x - coordinate by substituting it into the function.<br>
  y - intercepts indicate coordinates that touch the y - axis, or the line x = 0. The x - coordinates of a functions is always 0 on this vertical line. Similarly, you can use the x = 0 to find the corresponding y - coordinate of that point.</p>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="quadndisc2canva2.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw; text-align:center;"><b>b. Axis of Symmetry</b></p>
  <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:45vw;">The axis of symmetry refers to the line that divides the graph of a quadratic function into two equal parts. It has the line equation of x = -b/2a, where b is the coefficient of x, and a is the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup>. Using the x - coordinate obtained using that formula, the corresponding y - coordinate can be found by substituting the value into the quadratic function. If you see two points that intersect with the x - axis, you can add them both together and divide the sum by two to find the equation of the axis of symmetry as well.</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. Vertex</b></p>
  <p>A vertex (plural vertices) indicates the highest or lowest point on a quadratic function's graph. Negative quadratic functions open downwards, and have maximum points, while positive quadratic functions open upwards and have minimum points. The x - coordinate of the vertex also indicates the equation of the axis of symmetry, because no other point on the graph has the same y - coordinate as that point.</p>

  <h3>Section 4.3: Quadratic Forms</h3>
  <p> There are several forms of the quadratic function that can be used to favor what the question asks for. Let's take a look at some common ones.</p>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="quadndisc2canva3.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. x - intercept Form</b></p>
  <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">This form is usually useful to find the x - intercepts of a function, and usually looks like: y = a (x - p) (x - q), where p and q are the x - intercepts of the function. Since there are two points that intersect with the x - axis, the x - coordinate of the vertex as well as the equation of the axis of symmetry can be found by adding the two points together and dividing their sum. With this we have the general rule x = (p + q)/2. To find the y - coordinate of the vertex, simply substitute the value obtained back into the function.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="quadndisc2canva4.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. y - intercept Form</b></p>
  <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> This form is the easiest to use when the question asks for the function's y - intercept, thus granting its name. The format of this form usually looks like: y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c. You can directly substitute x = 0 into the equation and you get y = c as the y - intercept. To get the x - intercept, you can make y = 0, and apply the quadratic formula if applicable. The x - coordinate of the vertex (which is also the equation of the axis of symmetry) can directly be obtained by using the formula x = -b/2a, and inputting the value you get back to the function to find the y - coordinate of the vertex.</p><br><br><br>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. Vertex Form</b></p>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="quadndisc2canva5.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> This form is adjusted to directly help us find the vertex of the quadratic function. This last form involves a little twist. You need to understand the concept of 'completing the square'. Let's say we have y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c, we take out a as a factor and place it outside the bracket enclosing ax<sup>2</sup> and bx, leave c as it is and outside the bracket. Then, divide whatever coefficient b has by 2, remove x and place 'square' outside the bracket. Next, expand the quadratic form and compare it with what we have originally. Subtract or add the excess terms to c, and there you have it, a vertex form. It usually has a common look of: y = a(x - h)<sup>2</sup> + k, where a is the factor, h is b after being divided by a and 2, and k is c after being added or subtracted by the excess term. The vertex is directly located at the coordinate (h,k) and the axis of symmetry at x = h. There are cases in which k doesn't exist anymore because it's cancelled out by the excess term. In this case the form becomes y = a(x - h)<sup>2</sup>, without the k because k = 0. In this case, the vertex is located at (h, 0), and the axis of symmetry remains the same.</p><br><br>

  <h3>Section 4.4: Discriminants for Different Roots</h3>
  <p> We can use discriminants to predict how many roots, or solutions a quadratic function can have. Recall that roots make the quadratic function equal to 0, and are the x-intercepts of the said functions. The predictions are seen below.</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Two Distinct Roots</b></p>
  <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> If the quadratic function has two distinct roots, its discriminant is usually more than 0 (D > 0). This can be seen on the graph of quadratic functions in x - intercept forms. There are two coordinates in which y = 0, which indicates two distinct roots.</p>
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. Two Identical Roots</b></p>
  <p  style=" padding:1vw; width:50vw;">If the quadratic function has two identical roots, its discriminant is usually more than or equal to 0 (D â‰¥ 0). This can be seen on the graph of quadratic functions in vertex form, but with the value of k being 0, meaning the coordinate of the vertex is at y = 0. It indicates two of the same roots, which is seen when the vertex touches the x - axis.</p>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="quadndisc2canva7.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. No Real Roots</b></p>
  <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">If the quadratic function has no real roots, its graph shouldn't touch the x - axis because no values fulfill it. When you see this case, the discriminant is usually less than 0 (D < 0).</p>
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>d. One Real Root</b></p>
  <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">If the quadratic function has one real root, its discriminant is equal to 0. Similar to the case where the quadratic function has two identical roots, the graph only touches one coordinate on the x - axis, this only having 1 root.</p>
