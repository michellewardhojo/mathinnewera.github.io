  <h2>Chapter 2: Logarithm</h2>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva1.png" class="image3">
  <h3 style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Section 2.1: What is Logarithm?</h3>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Logarithm is the opposite of exponents which we have learned last chapter. In solving exponents, we are aiming to find the product, but in solving logarithms, we are aiming to find the exponent.<br>
    General form: log <sub>a</sub>b<br>
    Example: log <sub>3</sub>9 = 2, has a similar meaning to 3<sup>2</sup> = 9</br>
    Important-to-note:<br>
    1. a, the base, should always be more than 0.<br>
    2. When no base is written, it can be assumed that the base is equal to 10.<br>
    3. Logarithms with base 0 or 1 are not commonly written or used because when multiplied to any power, their results will always be 0 and 1, or it doesn't exist, respectively.<br>

  <h3>Section 2.2: Common Logarithmic Laws</h3>
  <p>Similar with exponents, logarithms also have rules for addition, subtraction and multiplication. Division and multiplication in logarithms are commonly done together, so for this chapter, we will discuss them as one. The rules work like the exponents, just slightly different.<br></p>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva2.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Product Rule</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">This rule states that: log<sub>a</sub>bc = log<sub>a</sub>b + log<sub>a</sub>c.<br>
  Using this rule will require both of the bases to be the same (as can be seen on the example, both bases are a). This rule cannot be directly be used if the bases are different.<br>
  We can prove this rule by using the following example:<br>
  log<sub>2</sub>32 = log<sub>2</sub>4 + log<sub>2</sub>8 --> log<sub>2</sub>(4)(8) = log<sub>2</sub>4 + log<sub>2</sub>8<br>
  Left side: log<sub>2</sub>(4)(8) = log<sub>2</sub>32 = 5<br>
  Right side: log<sub>2</sub>4 + log<sub>2</sub>8 = 2 + 3 = 5<br>
  As we can see, they both produce the same results, thus the formula is valid.</p><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva3.png" class="image3">
  <p style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw; text-align:center;"><b>b. Quotient Rule</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">This next rule states: log<sub>a</sub>b/c = log<sub>a</sub>b - log<sub>a</sub>c, oppositely to the previous. <br>
  Similar like before, it requires both bases to be the same. Here's an example:<br>
  log<sub>3</sub>3 = log<sub>3</sub>27 - log<sub>3</sub>9 --> log<sub>3</sub>(27รท9) = log<sub>3</sub>27 - log<sub>3</sub>9 <br>
  Left side: log<sub>3</sub>(27รท9) = log<sub>3</sub>3 = 1<br>
  Right side: log<sub>3</sub>27 - log<sub>3</sub>9 = 3 - 2 = 1<br>
  Both sides are once again equal to each other.<br><br></p><br><br>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva4.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"><b>Quick question: What happens if the logarithm can't be converted to a whole number?</b><br>
  Not all logarithms can be equal to whole numbers, but we don't have to compute them that way all the time. Both the Product and Quotient Laws are of great use here. <b>You can always divide or multiply their results first, then solve the logarithm.</b> An example is provided on the right.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva5.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. Power Rule</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">What happens when the result of the logarithm is in exponential form? Let's say it looks something like ths format: log<sub>a</sub>b<sup>c</sup>. The form can be changed into a normal logarithm in it's simplified form by <b>moving the exponent to the front and make it the coefficient</b>. This results in the following principle:<br>
  <p>log<sub>a</sub>b<sup>c</sup> = clog<sub>a</sub>b<br>
  This rule can also be applied to negative exponents, this is discussed below.<br><br><p><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva6.2.png" class="image4">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>i. Negative Logarithms</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">We know that logarithms can't have a negative base, but the expression itself can be represented in negative values.<br>
  For example, we have - log<sub>a</sub>b, we can transform the negative sign and make the term positive by making -log<sub>a</sub>b = x, and log<sub>a</sub>b = -x, from which we can change into a<sup>-x</sup> = b<br>
  (a<sup>-x</sup>)(a<sup>x</sup>) = b(a<sup>x</sup>)--> 1 = b(a<sup>x</sup>)<br>
  b<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>x</sup> --> log<sub>a</sub>b<sup>-1</sup> = x<br>
  From here we can obtain -(log<sub>a</sub>b) = log<sub>a</sub>(b<sup>-1</sup>)</p><br>

  <h3>Section 2.3: Change of Base Law</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva7.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">The bases of logarithmic expressions can be changed into any number (as long as it's positive) that can help us solve the question easier. It only involves a little twist. Let's say we have log<sub>a</sub>b, and we would like to change the base to c. The expression can be changed like below:<br>
  log<sub>a</sub>b = log<sub>c</sub>b/log<sub>c</sub>a<br>
  Note: Usually questions won't ask you to solve the logarithms completely. Either they ask you to express it as it is, the logarithmic expressions can be expressed into whole numbers, or that calculators are allowed to be used to evaluate it. Most of the time it's the first and second possibilities, though.<br>
  This rule helps us eliminate one logarithmic expression or get its form closer to what the question requires you to find. An example provided on the right explains the application of this statement.</p>

  <h3>Section 2.4: Less Common Logarithmic Laws</h3>
  <p> There are less common logarithmic rules that are very useful in solving equations. These are actually the maniulation of the rules that we've discussed before, mainly the Change of Base Law and the Power Rule.</p>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva8.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Reciprocal of Logarithms</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> We know that the 'reciprocal' of a number is that number as a denominator with 1 as the numerator, like the reciprocal of a would be 1/a. This applies a little bit differently in logarithms, and it's basically using the change of base rule, but the new base is equal to the logarithm's result. Below is how it's done:<br>
  We'll use log<sub>a</sub>b, and change it with a new base of b (because b is the logarithm's result). Doing that we have:<br>
  log<sub>a</sub> = log<sub>b</sub>b/log<sub>b<a>, where log<sub>b</sub> can be converted into 1.<br>
  So, log<sub>a</sub>b = 1/log<sub>b</sub>a, which is its reciprocal.<br>
  Commonly, this rule is expressed as log<sub>a</sub>b x log<sub>b</sub> = 1, because when a number is multiplied by its reciprocal, it equals to 1.</p>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva9.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. Logarithm as Exponents</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Another less commonly known logarithmic law is when a logarithmic expression becomes an exponent. Let's take a<sup>log<sub>a</sub>b</sup> as an example. It looks similar to when coverting log<sub>a</sub>a to 1. Well it's almost as simple as that. Let's make our example equal to x:<br>
  x = a<sup>log<sub>a</sub>b</sup>, and by using the common logarithmic law, we get log<sub>a</sub>x = log<sub>a</sub>b<br>
  This gives us x = b, and when substituted back to it's original value, we have a<sup>log<sub>a</sub>b</sup> = b.<br>
  An example with numbers is provided on the right.<br>
  From this, the rule a<sup>log<sub>c</sub>b</sup> = b<sup>log<sub>c</sub>a</sup> also applies.</p><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva10.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. The Base is an Exponential Expression</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Now what if the base can be expressed as an exponential expression? We know that the result's exponent can be expressed as a coefficient, well the base's exponent can be too. However, the base's exponent's reciprocal will be used as the coefficient. An example is provided below:<br>
  We have log<sub>a<sup>b</sup></sub>x, the reciprocal of its base's exponent is 1/b. Move that to the front:<br>
  log<sub>a<sup>b</sup></sub>x = 1/b x log<sub>a</sub>x.<br>
  When the result also can be expressed as an exponential expression, their coefficients can be combined. We get:log<sub>a<sup>b</sup></sub>x<sup>c</sup> = c/b x log<sub>a</sub>x, the overall coefficient will be the exponent of the result divided by the exponent of the base.<p>

  <h3>Section 2.5: Natural Logarithms</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="logcanva11.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Leonhard Euler is a Swiss mathematician who invented Euler's constant e, which is approximately 2.781828 and used commonly in logarithms and integrals.<br>
  Natural logarithms become more frequently encountered in Grade 10. They are logarithms that use a mathematical constant e - Euler's number - as the logarithm's base. It is usually represented as lnx, which has the same meaning as log<sub>e</sub>x. Involving the Change of Base Law, another uncommon rule can be derived. Let's say we have lna (or log<sub>e</sub>a).<br>
  The rule states lna = log<sub>e</sub>10 x log<sub>10</sub>a<br>
  This is delivered from the expression loga = log<sub>e</sub>a/log<sub>e</sub>10, which has the same format as the Change of Base Law. Remember that when the logarithmic expression has no base, its base is 10.<br>
  This rule is basically converting ln (logarithm base e) to the familiar log we often use.</p><br>
