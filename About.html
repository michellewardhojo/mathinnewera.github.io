      <p> The author has observed in her school community that there are many types of learners. Three of the most common ones are: a). Visual Learners, who learn best with images; b). Verbal Learners who learn best by listening to tutorials; and c). Physical Learners who needs examples to perform their best. To accommodate  these different types of learners, the author has created a website that provides the tools to help Learners study Mathematics in a more student-friendly way – quick, effective, and stress-free. The topics are taken from the International Baccalaureate (IB) school curriculum (Grades 9 – 10) and adapted into a modern media of study.<br>
This website does not guarantee that learning Mathematics will be easy or can be done overnight as there is always a learning process behind. Tools of learning should be complemented with effort, to make the whole process successful. At the end, the author hopes this website will help to improve the Learners’ academic performance, especially in Mathematics.</p>
