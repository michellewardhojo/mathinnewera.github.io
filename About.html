      <h2 style="font-size:1.5vw;">About the Website</h2>
      <p> There are many types of learners and most of the time, the study media that schools provide does not support the needs of these students. This is the issue the author has observed in her school community. It's not that the students are bad at it, rather that they need to be taught in a more comfortable way. There are Visual Learners who learn best with images, Verbal Learners who learn best with people's speeches, and Physical Learners who needs examples to perform their best. This website provides the needs for the three common types of students at school with the media they are most comfortable to study with in hope that it will increase their academic performance especially in Mathematics.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Objective/Aim</h2>

      <p>This website is aimed to make learning mathematics easier and more fun for MYP students. The topics are taken from the school curriculum and is adapted into a modern media of study which helps young learners to understand the concepts faster and in a less stressful way. This website does not fully guarantee that learning math will be easy or can be done overnight as every process takes time and effort. However, it's aimed to enlighten the user's mood and lift their heavy study burdens in order to provide them more energy and time for studying or attending other activities, thus balancing their social and academic performances and improving their mental and physical health.</p>

      <p >Michelle Alessandra Wardhojo is a student from Tunas Muda School who has quite an experience with Mathematics. Below are several awards she managed to obtain throughout her years of competing in math internationally:<br>
        - Japanese International Science and Math Olympiad (JISMO) Jakarta Medalist - 2016<br>
        - World Mathematics Team Championship (WMTC) Thailand Medalist - 2017<br>
        - Southeast Asian Mathematics Olympiad (SEAMO - X) Singapore Medalist - 2019<br>
        - World Mathematics Invitational (WMI) Japan Medalist - 2019<br>
        - World Mathematics Invitational (WMI) Online Medalist - 2020<br>
        - Kumon Completer of both Math (2020) and English Literature (2017)<br>
        Through these experiences, she finds Mathematics as a challenging subject, yet is an intriguing subject worth studying. She realises that Mathematics is an important skill in life, that everyone should learn. From simple addition and subtraction used in buying and selling, to calculus used in engineering majors, Mathematics is involved.<br><br>
