  <h2>Chapter 9: Reciprocal Function</h2>

  <h3>Section 9.1: What is a Reciprocal Function?</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="recipfunccanva1.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> We know that the reciprocal of 2 is 1/2, and so if we have a function f(x), its reciprocal function would be 1/f(x). A reciprocal function is a function in which the function becomes the denominator of a fraction with 1 as the numerator. f(x) and 1/f(x) share the same x - coordinates, but different y - coordinates.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 9.2: Elements of a Reciprocal Function</h3>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Vertical Asymptote and Roots</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> The vertical asymptote(s) of f(x) are the roots of 1/f(x), and the vertical asymptote(s) of 1/f(x) are the roots of f(x). When you make f(x) = 0, you get its roots, but when f(x) = 0, 1/f(x) is undefined, which is why the roots of f(x) and the asymptotes of 1/f(x) should have the same value. This applies the other way around as well.</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. x and y - intercepts</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> f(x)'s y - intercept is the reciprocal of 1/f(x)'s y - intercept. If the y - intercept of f(x) is at (0,2), then 1/f(x)'s y - intercept is at (0,1/2). y - intercepts only exist when the original function is already a fraction. If f(x) is linear, there is no y - intercept. This applies the same with their x - intercepts, all reciprocal functions have x - intercepts. If f(x)'s x - intercept is at (-3,0), then 1/f*x)'s would be at (-1/3,0). These rules apply the other way around, too. If 1/f(x)'s x and y intercepts are at (-1/4,0) and (0, 1/3) respectively, 1/f(x)'s x and y intercepts are at (-4, 0) and (0,3) respectively.</p><br>

  <h3>Section 9.3: Graphing a Reciprocal Function</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="recipfunccanva3.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> Sometimes questions require you to use your logical thinking and graph a reciprocal function without much information. For example, you are not given f(x), but only its axes intercepts or asymptotes. The example given on the image on the right shows you how it's done.<br>
  Here are some general steps that can help you graph a reciprocal function of a function that isn't even given:<br>
  1. Find the x - intercept(s).<br>
  2. Find the y - intercept (if the function isn't linear).<br>
  3. Plot the x - intercept and the y - intercept on the graph.<br>
  4. Mark the vertical and horizontal (if any) asymptotes.<br>
  5. Draw the other half of the graph on the opposite side of the asymptotes.<br>
  Use the principles in Section 9.2 to help you fins the intercepts as well as the asymptotes, because with simple logic, even if the original function isn't given, we can draw the graph of its reciprocal.</p>
