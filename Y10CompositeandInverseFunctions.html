  <h2>Chapter 7: Composite and Inverse Functions</h2>

  <h3>Section 7.1: What are Composite and Inverse Functions?</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="compinvcanva1.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">A composite function is a type of function that is created when another function is substituted into it. Let's say we have f(x) = x + 1 and g (x) = 2x as functions. When we say f(g(x)), it means to insert g(x)'s function into f(x), so f(g(x)) = 2x + 1 as 2x replaces x in f(x). We can also insert g(x) into f(x), we substitute x + 1 to replace x in 2x, so we get g(f(x)) = 2(x + 1).<br>
  An inverse function is a type of function that is created when you switch the places of x and y, and if f(x) is our function, its inverse is denoted by f<sup>-1</sup>(x), any function notation with <sup>-1</sup> indicates that it's the inverse of that function. For example we have f(x) = 2x + 1, we can make x the subject of the function while using f(x) as y, and we have x = 1/2(y - 1), and f<sup>-1</sup>(x) = 1/2(x - 1) after we switched the places of x and y.</p><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 7.2: Solving Composite Functions</h3>

  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Composite function - related questions sometimes include symbols such as (f o g)(x), which means the same as f(g(x)), but is denoted simpler. Sometimes it involves the symbols (f o g o h)(x) or something similar, it means f(g(h(x))), but the previous form does look neater doesn't it? If there are more than 2 functions however, you have to follow the order in substituting the functions. In (f o g o h)(x), you have to work from the right to the left, meaning substituting h(x) into g(x) first, and its result then substituted into f(x).<br>
  An example on the differences and how to equate them can be seen on the image on the left.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 7.3: Solving Inverse Functions</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="compinvcanva3.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> Sometimes questions ask you to find the inverse of a function, let's say f(x). We know how to do that from Section 7.1. If we needed to find f<sup>-1</sup>(3), you would think the first step is to find f(x)'s inverse and substitute x = 3 into it right? What if I told you there's a simpler way to find it? There's a rule for inverse functions that can help you skip that step. f<sup>-1</sup>(3) has the same value with f(x) = 3. Make the function equal to the x value will help you find the result of when the x value is substituted into the function's inverse. This speeds up your process of thinking and helps you out when not much information is given.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h3>Section 7.4: Rules Relating Composite and Inverse Functions</h3>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="compinvcanva4.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. (f<sup>-1</sup> o f)(x) = (f o f<sup>-1</sup>)(x) = x</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;"> When you input a function into its inverse or vice versa, they cancel out and the x value remains.</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. (f o f<sup>-1</sup> o g)(x) = g(x)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Still related to the previous rule, having a function and its inverse as the first two functions stated will cancel each other out, leaving the function closest to '(x)' alone. However, since the order matters, (f o g o f<sup>-1</sup>)(x) will not be equal to g(x).</p><br><br>

  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="compinvcanva5.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. (g<sup>-1</sup> o f<sup>-1</sup>)(a) --> (g<sup>-1</sup> o f)(x) = a --> f(x) = g (a)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">As mentioned in Section 7.3, you can 'switch sides' with the functions by finding their inverses. This applies for this rule. You can move a to the other side, as well as g(x), so it makes g(a).</p>

  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>d. (f o g)<sup>-1</sup> = (g<sup>-1</sup> o f<sup>-1</sup>)(x)</b></p>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">When the inverse sign (<sup>-1</sup>) is 'collective' or outside a set of parentheses with more than one function, it can be distributed inside. It flips the order of the functions and inverses them both.</p><br>
