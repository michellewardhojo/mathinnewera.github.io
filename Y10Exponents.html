  <h2>Chapter 1: Exponents</h2>

  <img BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva1.png" class="image3">
  <h3 style="padding: 1vw; width: 50vw;"> Section 1.1: What are Exponents?</h3>
  <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Exponents are a shortened version of repeated multiplication of the same number.<br>
    <b>General Form:</b> a <sup>b</sup>, which implies a x a x a x a x ... (b times)<br>
    <b>Example:</b> 2 <sup>6</sup> implies 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64<br>
    <b>Important-to-note:</b><br>
    1. Any number with the power of 2 can be pronounced as "squared" and with the power of 3 as "cubed", such as 5 <sup>2</sup> ('five squared') and 5 <sup>3</sup> ('five cubed'). <br>
    2. Powers of 1 are usually not written down because its value is equal to itself.<br>
  </p><br>

  <h3> Section 1.2: Exponential Laws for the Same Base</h3>
  <p>Just like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponents have laws, too! They can be manipulated to make counting easier, here's how:</p>
  <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva2.png" class="image3">
  <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw; text-align:center;"><b>a. Product of Powers (Addition of Exponents)</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">This law can be applied when multiplying two numbers with the same base. Their exponents may be different or the same.<br>
    For example we have: 4<sup>3</sup> and 4<sup>5</sup>,we can add them up like below:<br></p>
    <p style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">4<sup>3</sup> x 4<sup>5</sup> <br>
    = 4<sup>(3+5)</sup><br>
    = 4<sup>8</sup><br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">If you think this law is pretty straightforward, the next one should be too.</p>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva3.png" class="image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. The Quotient Rule (Subtraction of Exponents)</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Similar with the Product of Powers Law, this rule should only be applied when the two numbers have the same base.<br>
    Here's an example, let's say we would like to divide 3<sup>4</sup> by 3<sup>3</sup>:<br></p>
    <p style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">3<sup>4</sup> ÷ 3<sup>3</sup><br>
    3<sup>(4-3)</sup><br>
    3<sup>1 </sup>= 3<br></p><br><br>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva4.png" class = "image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>bi. Negative powers</b><br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">For some cases, a smaller exponent may be divided by a larger one. As you might have speculated, the smaller exponent should be subtracted by a larger one, resulting in a negative exponent. Not to worry because negative exponents, in fact, do exist. We can represent them as fractions. The example below should put this explanation into application:<br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Let's say we'd like to divide 7<sup>6</sup> from 7<sup>4</sup>,<br>
    7<sup>4</sup> ÷ 7<sup>6</sup>
    = 7<sup>(4-6)</sup>
    = 7<sup>-2</sup>
    = 1/7<sup>2</sup> = 1/49 </p><br><br>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva5.png" class = "image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;text-align:center;"><b>bii. Power of Zero</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Subtraction of the same number always leads to zero. Just like negative powers, zero powers exist as well. Anything to the zero-th power is always equal to 1. Mathematicians decided so to make computations easier. Here's an example:<br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">3<sup>10</sup>÷3<sup>10</sup><br>
    = 3<sup>(10-10)</sup><br>
    = 3<sup>0</sup> <br>
    = 1<br></p>
    <p  style="background-color: #E0FFFF; padding:1vw;"><b>Pro Tip:</b><br>
    Remember that anything to the power of zero is equal to 1. This applies to every number or notation. Even really huge numbers like 1000, or complex equations like [n(n+1)-1001]. This comes in handy in solving olympiad-based problems.</p>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva6.png" class = "image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. Multiplication of Powers</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Powers can also be multiplied. It might be confusing how a form of multiplication can be multiplied even further, but let's take a look at this example:<br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">(7<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup><br>
    = 7<sup>(3 x 2)</sup><br>
    = 7 <sup>6</sup><br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">That's a simple example of an application of this law. Here's how to avoid confusion between using this law and the Product of Powers law:</p>
    <p  style="background-color: #E0FFFF; padding:1vw;"><b>When there are two of the same bases with separate exponents involved, use the Product of Powers law, while if there's only one base with two exponents in brackets, use the Multiplication of Powers law.</b></p>
    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="exp8.png"  class = "image3">
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">For example we have 3<sup>3</sup> x 3<sup>6</sup> and (3<sup>3</sup>)<sup>6</sup>.<br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">We can see that 3<sup>3</sup> x 3<sup>6</sup> has the same base, but two separate exponents. We will use the Product of Powers law.<br>
    3<sup>3</sup> x 3<sup>6</sup>
    = 3<sup>(3+6)</sup>
    = 3<sup>9</sup><br>
    Whereas (3<sup>3</sup>)<sup>6</sup> has only one base and two different exponents, the Multiplication of Powers can be used for this case.<br>
    (3<sup>3</sup>)<sup>6</sup>
    = 3<sup>(3 x 6)</sup>
    = 3<sup>18</sup><br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">As you can see, the two results are very different. It is crucial not to mistaken one rule for the other.</p><br><br>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva9.png" class = "image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>ci. Distribution of Powers</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Just like multiplying a common factor in algebraic notations, powers can be distributed as well. This is also a common mistake between students, it is important that we know the concept thoroughly.Let's say we have an expression (xy)<sup>a</sup>.<br>
    To expand this expression, we should distribute the exponent 'a' to both x and y like so:<br>
    (xy)<sup>a</sup> = x<sup>a</sup>y<sup>a</sup><br>
    This should not be confused with xy<sup>a</sup> as these two expressions have different values. We can easily see the difference when we expand them like below:<br>
    (xy)<sup>a</sup> = x<sup>a</sup>y<sup>a</sup> --> xy<sup>a</sup> = x(y)<sup>a</sup><br></p><br>
    <p  style="background-color: #E0FFFF; padding:1vw;">We can see that xy<sup>a</sup> only applies the exponent to the variable it's attached to. <b>We need a pair of parentheses to indicate that the exponent is applied for both variables.</b></p>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva11.png"  class = "image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>d. Division of Powers</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Lastly, exponents can be divided. Though this is not common, some exponents are divided using fractional exponents or roots (e.g. the power of one-third can be expressed as a cube root).<br>
    Here's an example of this law's application:<br>
    <sup>3</sup>√(x<sup>6</sup>y<sup>3</sup>)<br>
    = (x<sup>6</sup>y<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup><br>
    = x<sup>(6 x 1/3)</sup>y<sup>(3 x 1/3)</sup><br>
    = x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>1</sup><br>
    = x<sup>2</sup>y<br></p>
    <p  style="background-color: #E0FFFF; padding:1vw;">The same rule for Multiplication of Powers applies for division, too. With the parentheses, the exponent applies for both. Without the parentheses, the exponent only applies for the base on which the exponent is attached to. For roots, the division of the exponent is only applied to the terms or variable under the root sign. Other terms outside the roots sign are not affected.<br></p>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva12.png"class = "image3">
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>di. Fractional Exponents</b></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">From the result of the division of powers above, some exponent results as a fraction. Not to worry because it can simply be represented just like before. <br>
    We'll take (2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup> as an example, from which:<br></p>
    <p  style="padding:1vw; width:50vw;">(2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup> can be changed into (2<sup>2 x 1/3 </sup>) using the Multiplication of Powers Law.<br>
    So, we have (2<sup>2/3</sup>) which can be separated into:<br>
    <sup>3</sup>√2<sup>2</sup> = <sup>3</sup>√4</p><br>
    <p  style="background-color: #E0FFFF; padding:1vw;">As we can observe from the numerator of the power goes 'inside' the root, while the denominator acts as index for the root as stays 'outside'.</p>
    <p>So, have you noticed how beneficial exponents are? With exponents, we are saved from having to tediously multiply the same number repetitively. If you think these have made counting easier, more rules are coming to simplify counting even more!</p>

    <h3> Section 1.3: Exponential Laws for the Same Power</h3>
    <p>We've been talking about all the rules that apply to numbers with the same base, but what about the same power? Though these might not be very common, we can derive some logic and make sense of these rules.
    Similar with the laws we've discussed before, there will be one for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, this time, we will be manipulating the base instead.</p>

    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva13.png" class = "image3"><br>
    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw; width:50vw;  text-align:center;"><b>a. Addition of the Same Power</b></p>
    <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Do you happen to still remember the binomial expansion rule for two terms to the power of 2? Maybe it'll ring a bell when you see <b>(a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></b>. We will be using this rule and some of its other variations for this discussion.<br>
    We can change <b>(a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></b> into the form <b>a<sup>2</sup>+ b<sup>2</sup> = (a+b)<sup>2</sup> - 2ab</b>. <br>
    This form is now more recognizeable (as you can see, they have the same exponents). This method might not be needed in computing numbers, but is very useful in simplifying or computing algebraic expressions. Let's use it on an example to make this more interesting.<br>
    Let's say we have the following question, with its detailed solution on the right:</p><br><br>
    <IMG BORDER="1" SRC="egqexp1.png" class="image3">
    <IMG BORDER="1" align = "Right" SRC="egqexp1sol.png" class = "image3"><br><br>

    <br><br><p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw;  text-align:center;"><b>b. Subtraction of the Same Power</b></p>
    <p>Now just as you may have expected, we are going to use the opposite formula for this one. We will now use <b>(a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></b> as an example.</b><br>
    We will change it into <b>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = (a-b)<sup>2</sup> + 2ab</b>.<br>
    This is similar to the previous rule, but the rule you choose to use will depend on the information given. This next question might explain this better.<br><br>
    <IMG BORDER="1" SRC="egqexp2.png"  class="image3">
    <IMG BORDER="1" align = "Right" SRC="egqexp2sol.png" class = "image3"><br></p>

    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw;  text-align:center;"><b>c. Multiplication of the Same Power</b></p>
    <p>This rule is a lot more simple than the previous two we've discussed before. For multiplication and division of the same base, we can directly 'merge' the bases or multiply them together and just apply the exponent.We can see this method being used in the example below:<br><br>
    <IMG BORDER="1" SRC="egqexp3.png" class="image3">
    <IMG BORDER="1" align = "Right" SRC="egqexp3sol.png"  class = "image3"><br></p><br><br><br>

    <p  style="background-color: #87CEFA; padding:1vw;  text-align:center;"><b>d. Division of the Same Power</b></p>
    <p>Similar to the multiplication of the same base rule, we can directly multiply the bases and place one exponent to represent both exponents. This has an obvious correlation with the distribution of powers law we discussed before. Here's another example to make this clear:<br><br>
    <IMG BORDER="1" SRC="egqexp4.png"  class="image3">
    <IMG BORDER="1" align = "Right" SRC="egqexp4sol.png" class = "image3"><br></p>

    <h3>Section 1.4: Exponents on Exponents</h3>
    <IMG BORDER="1" ALIGN="Right" SRC="expcanva14.png" class = "image3"><br></p>
    <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">Sometimes we see unusual expressions of exponents like 3<sup>3<sup>2</sup></sup>. The key to solving this is not to count it manually. It would probably take hours to find the actual number as a solution, and most exams don't generally ask you to solve it literally.
    What we can do is solve the exponent first or from the 'top'. Similar to order of operations, we cannot solve this by cubing 3, but instead squaring the exponent (the small 3) first. This is what it looks like:<br></p>
    <p  style= "padding:1vw; width:50vw;">3<sup>3<sup>2</sup></sup> = 3<sup>(3<sup>2</sup></sup>) = 3<sup>9</sup> <br>
    NOT 3<sup>3<sup>2</sup></sup> = (3<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 27<sup>2</sup> <br>
    (because 27<sup>2</sup> = (3<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 3<sup>6</sup> ≠ 3<sup>9</sup>)</p>
